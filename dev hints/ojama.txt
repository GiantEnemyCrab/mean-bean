Ojama (garbage)

Whenever a rensa is achieved, Ojama (Garbage blocks) are sent to the
opponent. The bigger the Fluent Rensa is, the more ojamas are sent to
the opponent. It is calculated by the overall score of the chain divided
by 70 and rounded up to the nearest integer. For example:

  * Player A forms a group of 4 red puyos as a single chain.
  * The score card reads "40 x 1" (Simply by the following:
      (Puyo * 10) x (Puyo - 3) -> (4 * 10) x (4 - 3) -> 40 x 1).
  * 40 x 1 is the total score of the chain, so this is divided by 70,
      to give 0.571 (to 3.s.f)
  * This value is rounded up to the nearest integer, which is 1.
  * One ojama will fall on the opponent's grid.

If more puyos are erased in succession due to a Fluent Rensa, the amount
of garbage will keep going up until the chain ends. Ojama puyos are
dropped in rows of six, with the extra ojamas distributed in random
columns. If more than 30 ojamas are sent, they will be dropped in groups
of 30.

Ojama block the opponent's playing field, and can cause them to lose if
they reach up to the top of the grid. Ojama are eliminated if puyos are
eliminated adjacent to them.
